Rules of default bean names (inside a component annotation):

1. class "HappyFortuneService" -> bean name "happyFortuneService"
2. class "RESTFortuneService" -> bean name "RESTFortuneService"
3. class "IFortuneService" -> bean name "IFortuneService"

As we can see above, if we have two first letters of classname in upper case, 
then default bean name is the same of classname.
